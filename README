These tests are based on Jerome Glisse's tree:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/glisse/svm-cl-tests
with additional tests added for new features such as THP migration and mapping.

These are basically just smoke/sanity tests to exercise the functionality
and depend on work in progress for mesa OpenCL 2.2 support and Linux
kernel work on HMM and nouveau to support THP migration to device private
memory and THP system memory mappings in nouveau.
